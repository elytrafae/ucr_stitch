Gravity Duper textures by Adapt

"Bar textures 1": 
First two bars are recolored versions of some of "https://github.com/apace100/origins-fabric/blob/1.18/src/main/resources/assets/origins/textures/gui/community/spiderkolo/resource_bar_02.png". 
Fifth one is a recolored version of "https://github.com/apace100/origins-fabric/blob/1.18/src/main/resources/assets/origins/textures/gui/community/huang/resource_bar_01.png" #7
Sixth one is a recolored version of "https://github.com/apace100/origins-fabric/blob/1.18/src/main/resources/assets/origins/textures/gui/community/spiderkolo/resource_bar_03.png" #16. 
The rest are drawn by me.
